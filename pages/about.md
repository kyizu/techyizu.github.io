# About Techyizu

**Techyizu** is a non-profit volunteer-driven organization that supports the China startup and tech community.  We organize events for people with a passion for technology, entrepreneurship, and social innovation.  We believe in an open community for sharing knowledge and experience, and that the connections we help build through our events can lead to amazing things.
