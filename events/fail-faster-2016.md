And are you interested in learning more about lean startup? We have something for you! Come to FailFaster, Techyizu’s 3-day workshop to help you learn how to build the right product. During this event, you will learn the foundations of lean startup and how to apply the customer development process to a real startup idea!  

The event will start on Friday, September 9 at 7:00 PM at the Hero Center. If you have an idea for a startup, come ready to do a 1-minute pitch of your idea. You will then form a team of 4-5 people to develop the idea on Saturday and Sunday.  

Over the weekend, you’ll learn how to test your customer hypothesis, problem hypothesis, and solution hypothesis. You’ll also get help from experienced startup mentors. There will be workshops on customer interviewing, designing an MVP, and how to pivot. A key thing to note is that you’ll spend time over the weekend talking to real potential customers! The event will end with each team presenting their validated learnings to a panel of mentors that will provide feedback.

Our generous sponsors China Accelerator are putting 1000 RMB toward the winning team!
