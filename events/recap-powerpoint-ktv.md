Techyizu spiced up our monthly Happy Hour event with our first ever PowerPoint KTV (PPT KTV)! What is PPT KTV? It’s an improv game where the players stand up in front of an audience and are put in front of a random Powerpoint presentation. The player must then immediately give a presentation based on that Powerpoint deck.
In total, 13 brave participants gave 3 minute presentations on ridiculous topics we’d cooked up the night before. How ridiculous? Here were some of the titles:

* “The best thing about Cats”
* “Exercise sucks, or does it?”
* “Cyborgs are the future”

As always, thanks to our sponsors [Chinaccellerator](http://chinaccelerator.com/) and [People Squared](http://www.people-squared.com/en/). Also, special thanks to our event sponsor [Kulou](http://www.bonapp.cn/7118-restaurant-Kulou-.html).
