Building any new business, either within the context of a startup or an establish company, always include a good amount of waste. Epiphany usually happen at the end of the project when it is already too late. How can we minimize waste along the way and increase our chance of success?

The Lean Startup movement defines a systemic approach to reduce waste when doing product development. During the Techyizu Fail Faster event we will be applying the key concepts of the Lean Startup methodology to validate our business hypothesis before building any company around it.

You will pitch your business idea, gather a team and experience validated learning. With the help of our mentors, your team will define your productâ€™s assumptions and test them by getting out of the building and talking to your potential customers. Based on the feedback you decide whether to pivot or preserve.

At the end of the weekend, each team will share its experience and present the development its idea has gone through.
