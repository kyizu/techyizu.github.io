>“Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.”
---- Winston Churchill

On May 29th, Techyizu and local storytelling group Mamagushi partnered to bring together 11 local entrepreneurs and storytellers to share their tales of failure.

Stories of supplier betrayal, building the wrong product, and even missing out on true love were part of the evening.

Thanks to our event sponsor Masse Bistro & Bar as well as our main sponsors Chinaccellerator and People Squared. Did you miss out on the event? Join our Meetup group to be notified of upcoming Techyizu events!
