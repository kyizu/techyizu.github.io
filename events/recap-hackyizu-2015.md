On January 17th, Techyizu held its third hackathon at Shanghai’s People Squared Hero Co-working space. Tinkering experts and newbies alike joined for the two day event which featured not only a hack competition, but also instructor led beginner tracks. Teams built Arduino powered solutions from scratch, while beginners learned the basics of Arduino programming as well as laser cutting.

Highlight team projects included:

* An automated cat feeder controlled by RFID tags attached to cat collars
* A smart door unlocked by a customizable lock code – complete with an automated turret defense system!
* An auto-drive car that follows an object moving in front of it

Cheers to all our participants, and a big thanks to our sponsors for the event: DFRobot, XinCheJian, SingTel innov8, and People Squared!
