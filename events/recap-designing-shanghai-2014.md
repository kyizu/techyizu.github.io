DesignINg is an event series that applies human-centered design to solve hyper-local challenges within the community. This year, we explored the theme of “Designing for Scarcity”, which prompted many interesting questions.

In the morning, we had talks by Raefer Wallis from A00, CBi China Bridge, Denis Dessus Architecture, and Richard Brubaker, founder of Collective Responsibility.

Thanks to our venue sponsor, Espace Rhones-Alpes.
