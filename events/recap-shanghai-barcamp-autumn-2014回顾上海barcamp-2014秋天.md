## What is BarCamp??
BarCamp is a fun, user-generated “un-conference” that started in Silicon Valley as a response to formal, exclusive, and boring tech conferences. BarCamp is a full-day event with multiple sessions, workshops, and presentations on topics like technology, design, entrepreneurship, and social innovation. It is an open and sharing environment — everyone can attend, and everyone can participate.

## When is the next BarCamp?
